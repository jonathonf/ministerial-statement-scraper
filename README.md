A simple Ruby scraper/emailer (using nokogiri and pony) to fetch written Ministerial Statements from the Common's Hansard.

This is in response to the removal of an RSS feed from the Hansard site (http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/hansard/commons/todays-written-statements).

Remember to add your email address; otherwise you won't get any emails. :)
